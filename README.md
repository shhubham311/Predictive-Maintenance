# Predictive-Maintenance
Predictive Maintenance of industry equipment.

Predictive maintenance allows proactive identification of equipmentâ€™s issues, it utilizes data analysis, 
machine learning algorithms, IoT devices, sensor technology and anomaly detection. Unlike 
traditional methods used for maintenance, it anticipates potential problems before they cause 
downtime or costly breakdowns. It leverages historical data to optimize maintenance activities 
precisely whenever needed, mending faulty components to prevent shortages. This project 
employs two datasets: Bearings for anomaly detection and Battery for remaining useful life 
prediction. Utilizing both the supervised and unsupervised learning, it acknowledges predictive 
maintenance needs, focusing to minimize the unexpected downtime and reducing the cost. The 
project adopts the CRISP-DM methodology, encompassing data understanding, preparation, 
modelling, evaluation, and deployment phases. The solution of this project could help industry 
to lower the chance of unexpected downtime and reduce costs
